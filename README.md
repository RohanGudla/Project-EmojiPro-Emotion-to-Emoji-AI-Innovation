# Project Emojify: Adding Emotion to Online Communication

## About

Emojis and avatars play a vital role in conveying emotions during online communication. This project focuses on accurately representing facial expressions with emojis, enhancing online interactions.

## Goal

The main objective is to understand human facial expressions and display corresponding avatars or emojis that mirror these expressions.

## Dataset

The project uses the FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. Haarcascades classifiers from OpenCV are employed for face detection. Cuda-based haarcascades are utilized for better performance, but regular haarcascades can also be used.

## Facial Emotions Categories

The project classifies facial emotions into the following categories:
- 0: Angry
- 1: Disgusted
- 2: Fearful
- 3: Happy
- 4: Neutral
- 5: Sad
- 6: Surprised

## CNN for Facial Emotion Recognition

This project employs Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize human emotions in images. It utilizes the FER2013 dataset and creates a CNN architecture. The network includes dense and convolutional layers, employing the Softmax equation for model output.

## Requirements

Basic Requirements:
- FER2013 dataset from Kaggle
- Python and AI/ML knowledge
- Jupyter from Anaconda
- Emojis/Avatars

Required Libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- h5py
- NumPy
- Tkinter

## Additional Info

This project was developed using TensorFlow-GPU on Ubuntu 22.04 in Jupyter Notebook. Depending on the IDE and host OS, adjustments may be needed to address compatibility issues.
